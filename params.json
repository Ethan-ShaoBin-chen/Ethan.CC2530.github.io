It includes conventions for\n\n```markdown\nSyntax highlighted code block\n\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n\n- Bulleted\n- List\n\n1. Numbered\n2. List\n\n**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text\n\n[Link](url) and ![Image](src)\n```\n\nFor more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n\n### Jekyll Themes\n\nYour Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ethan-ShaoBin-chen/Ethan.CC2530.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.\n\n### Support or Contact\n\nHaving trouble with Pages?
